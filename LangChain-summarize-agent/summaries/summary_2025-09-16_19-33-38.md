## Comparative Analysis

### Article Title: INTELIGÊNCIA ARTIFICIAL GENERATIVA E AVALIAÇÃO EDUCACIONAL: UMA ANÁLISE DOCUMENTAL
- **Core Problem:** The research investigates what Brazilian and international public documents, published between 2022 and 2025, propose regarding the use of Generative AI in educational assessment, and how these guidelines might specifically impact assessment in language teaching.
- **Methodology:** The study employs a qualitative, bibliographic, and documentary research approach. The authors selected 16 public documents and utilized content analysis as the technique to categorize and interpret the data found within them.
- **Key Findings:** The analysis reveals that current guidelines advocate for a shift towards formative assessments that utilize AI. They emphasize the design of tasks to evaluate skills, competencies, and performances rather than traditional content recall. The findings also highlight a critical concern for the ethical use of AI, the mediating role of teachers, and the development of human creativity and qualifications. A central conclusion is the urgent need to foster AI literacy and adopt a process-oriented evaluation model that leverages AI tools without becoming solely dependent on them.
- **Relevance to GenAI in Education:** This article provides a structured analysis of official and public guidelines concerning Generative AI in educational assessment. It synthesizes the current international and Brazilian perspectives, offering a comprehensive overview of the challenges, ethical considerations, and recommended changes to assessment practices in response to the proliferation of AI technologies.

### Detailed Summary: INTELIGÊNCIA ARTIFICIAL GENERATIVA E AVALIAÇÃO EDUCACIONAL: UMA ANÁLISE DOCUMENTAL

This article conducts a qualitative documentary analysis to investigate how Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is addressed in the context of educational assessment. The authors examine 16 Brazilian and international public documents (including guidelines, reports, and policy papers) published between 2022 and 2025. The primary objective is to understand the recommendations these documents provide for assessment and to consider the potential impact on language teaching.

The methodology involves a three-phase content analysis. First, a pre-analysis phase identified and selected relevant documents from institutions like UNESCO, the U.S. Department of Education, and others. Second, the material was explored to identify specific sections related to assessment. Finally, the data was treated and interpreted to categorize the findings.

The results indicate that while there is a global concern regarding the ethical and pedagogical use of AI in education, only seven of the sixteen analyzed documents offer specific recommendations for assessment. These documents collectively argue for a fundamental shift in evaluation paradigms, moving beyond concerns of academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating) to rethink the very purpose and methods of assessment. The key recommendations that emerged from the analysis include:

1.  **Focus on Formative Assessment:** A strong emphasis is placed on continuous, process-oriented evaluation rather than summative, product-focused tests. AI is seen as a tool to enhance formative feedback cycles.
2.  **Task-Based Evaluation:** The documents propose designing authentic tasks (e.g., creating podcasts, lab work, group projects) that assess higher-order skills, competencies, and performance, which are more difficult to replicate with AI alone.
3.  **Development of AI Literacy:** A recurring theme is the necessity of fostering AI literacy among both educators and students to ensure critical, ethical, and effective use of these technologies.
4.  **Human-Centric Approach:** The analysis highlights the irreplaceable value of human skills such as critical thinking, ethical decision-making, and creativity. The goal is to use AI to complement and augment these human capabilities, not replace them.

The authors conclude that while the analyzed documents do not provide specific guidelines for language teaching assessment, the general principles are highly applicable. There is an urgent need to redesign assessment practices to be more formative and process-focused, leveraging AI's potential for personalization and feedback while maintaining academic integrity and fostering essential human skills.
