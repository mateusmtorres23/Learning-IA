# Learning-IA-

My personal journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This repository serves as a collection of projects and experiments as I explore different technologies and concepts in the AI space.

## Technologies & Skills

Here are some of the key libraries and frameworks I've been working with:

* **LangChain:** For building applications powered by language models, focusing on component modularity.
* **LangGraph:** For creating stateful, multi-step agentic systems with cyclical and branching logic.

## Projects

### ➡️ [LangChain-LangGraph-simple-project]

A project of a stateful, multi-step AI agent. This agent can triage user requests and then decide whether to answer them using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from a document base, ask for more information, or open a service ticket all decided by a graph structure.
